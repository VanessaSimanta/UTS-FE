                        Fun Fact! According to the Indonesian Ministry of Health Regulation No. 30 of 2013, 
                        the recommended daily intake of fat should not exceed 67 grams per day, which is equivalent to 20-25% of your daily caloric intake. 
                        Sodium intake should also be limited to no more than 2,000 milligrams per day. 
                        At first glance, it might seem that eating KFC is acceptable since these numbers are below the recommended limits. 
                        However, these values only apply to 93 or 86 grams of KFC chicken. In reality, it's uncommon for us to stop at just one piece. 
                        We often order additional chicken, fries, ice cream, rice, and other items, which can greatly increase our intake of calories, sodium, and fat.

                    Exercise is essential for our bodies, but it doesn't always have to mean intense workouts or lifting heavy weights at the gym.

                    can be just as effective. By staying active, we can ward off various health risks such as obesity, diabetes, stroke, and high blood

                        adults aged 18-64, and 7 to 8 hours for older adults (65 and over). Not getting enough sleep can lead to sleep deprivation, which

                    <h4>Smoking?</h4>
                    <p class="desc-b">
                        We all know that smoking is bad for your health. Smoking can cause lung disease by damaging your airways and the small air sacs 
                        (alveoli) in your lungs. It also increases the risk of developing cancer in almost any part of your body, as well as type 2 diabetes. 
                        The risk of developing diabetes is 30-40% higher for active smokers than for non-smokers. So, it's best to quit smoking, as the 
                        health risks are too many to ignore.
